    <h3>Academic Projects</h3>
  </b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4><b>Genome Sequencing Alignment</b></h4>
      <p>Similarity of two genes predicted to be mutated is found by performing dynamic programming.
        The minimum mismatch score is calculated and insights were drawn regarding new variants.
        Developed a divide and conquer approach algorithm to consume less space,
        resulted in almost 50% decline in memory usage.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4><b>Search Agent</b></h4>
      <p>Designed a heuristic search agent by executing global search strategies such as Breadth First Search(BFS),
        Depth First Search(DFS), Uniform Cost Search(UCS)
        and A* search. (Language : Java)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4><b>Moving Object Classification In A Video Sequence Under Illumination Changes Using Binary Descriptors</b></h4>
      <p>Initiated scene by detecting abrupt changes in video recorded from a static camera,
        by tabulating meta data for captured frames (1sec of video is converted to 60 frames).
        Then a particular scene is considered and background subtraction is done for detection of an object
        and features are extracted for classification of an object into a vehicle or a human(only two classes used).
        (Avg. Accuracy : 89%)
